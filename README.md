# Hibernet
A packetstormer that uses proxies or socks to attack.

Please suggest me some ideas, and report bugs!
Thanks!

To use it you have to use python3 and you also need 2 extra modules.

To install if you are running linux or mac, type:
<pre>pip3 install pysocks bs4</pre>

If you are down winzoz, type:
<pre>py -m pip install pysocks bs4</pre>

ENJOY!
